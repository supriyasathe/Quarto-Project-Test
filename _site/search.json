    "text": "A vital role for financial institutions is evaluating credit risk, which has a direct impact on lending choices, portfolio performance, and regulatory compliance. Because they are straightforward and easy to understand, traditional credit scoring techniques like logistic regression have gained widespread use. These conventional models, however, find it difficult to account for nonlinear patterns and complicated borrower behaviors as financial data grows in size, complexity, and heterogeneity.\nThe predictive accuracy of credit risk modeling has greatly increased as a result of recent developments in machine learning, especially ensemble-based techniques like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT). Among these techniques, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) has shown itself to be a very effective and scalable framework that can deal with imbalanced and high-dimensional credit datasets. Although LightGBM performs well, it is frequently perceived as a “black-box” paradigm, which restricts transparency and undermines confidence among auditors, regulators, and business users.\nThis paper suggests an Explainable Agentic AI framework for credit risk assessment utilizing LightGBM in order to overcome these issues. The framework combines an intelligent agentic decision layer that analyzes model predictions, produces insightful explanations, and suggests suitable courses of action with SHAP-based explainability. The suggested approach seeks to facilitate responsible and explicable credit decision-making in regulated financial environments by fusing prediction accuracy, transparency, and adaptive reasoning."

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\nFive active research pillars form the basis of this project:\n\nCredit Risk Modeling The statistical techniques used in early credit risk models, including logistic regression, are interpretable but outperform when applied to complicated, non-linear data. Recent studies have demonstrated that machine learning models, particularly ensemble approaches, greatly increase prediction accuracy. The most advanced models for structured financial data are gradient boosting models like XGBoost and LightGBM. LightGBM provides great speed, scalability, and efficiency for big credit datasets.\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) The black-box character of machine learning models is addressed by explainable AI. By demonstrating how features affect predictions, methods like LIME and SHAP offer both local and global explanations. Because SHAP is theoretically sound and enhances model validation, regulatory compliance, and trust, it is very useful in the finance sector.\nInterpretability in Financial Systems Automated decision systems must be fair, transparent, and accountable in order to comply with financial requirements. Explainable models are especially important in high-risk fields like credit scoring, where interpretability must be human-centered and adhere to ethical and regulatory norms.\nAgentic AI in Decision Systems By assessing outputs and suggesting actions, agentic AI systems surpass prediction. Agentic frameworks can combine explanation signals, risk thresholds, and model projections to initiate the proper reactions—approvals, rejections, or manual reviews—in financial decision-making. By verifying that decisions are transparent, flexible, and in line with human oversight, the combination of explainable models with agentic AI allows for responsible automation.\nResearch Gap Few systems combine agentic decision-making, explainability, and predictive modeling into a single framework, despite the widespread use of LightGBM and SHAP. By putting out an Explainable Agentic AI system for credit risk assessment, this project fills this gap."
